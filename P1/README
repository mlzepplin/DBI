Using the driver:
==================
UPDATE THESE FIELDS BEFORE COMPILING

1. SETTINGS: The following variables control the various file locations and they are declared in test.cc (just after the #include header declarations):
	o dbfile_dir -- this is where the created heap db-files will be stored. By default, this is set to "" (thus all the heap dbfiles will be created in the current directory).
	o tpch_dir -- this stores the directory path where the tpch-files can be found. REMEMBER TO UPDATE THIS!!!
	o catalog_path -- this stores the catalog file path. By default this is set to "". 


Procedure to build and execute program

	1) make clean
	2) make
	3) ./test.out

and follow the on-screen instructions.
